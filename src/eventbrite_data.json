    'description': u 'Pico Union Project presents: the acclaimed one-woman show Rachel Calof for two performances in November. A memoir with music, Rachel Calof is the true story of a Jewish picture bride\u2019s astonishing life in pioneer North Dakota, starring actress Kate Fuglei. Adapted from Calof\u2019s autobiography by playwright Ken LaZebnik, with music and lyrics by Leslie Steinweiss, and directed by Ellen S. Pressman, Rachel Calof will be performed on November 6 and 7 at 7:30 p.m. at The Pico Union Project, 1153 Valencia Street, in Los Angeles.\xa0 \nRachel Calof (Kate Fuglei) immigrated from Russia to America in 1894 as a young mail-order bride, setting in Devils Lake, North Dakota, where she and and her husband Abe endured brutal winters in a 12 by 14 foot shack. For years, their shack was shared by her in-laws, a brother-in-law, two dozen chickens, and a cow. Nine children were born there, and Rachel\u2019s story is alternately funny, touching, and triumphant. This saga of a Jewish woman\u2019s survival on the American plains is an untold piece of history, brought to life in a brilliant performance by actress Kate Fuglei. ',

What started as a personal project for a group of \xa0teachers at Johnnie Cochran Middle School in Council District 10, has spread to a city-wide program that is fundamentally changing the lives of talented low-income students throughout Los Angeles. This could not have happened without the vision and resources of change-making individuals and programs that have helped HYPE become the organization it is today.  \nThis year, we\u2019d like to honor one of our independent school partners, Harvard-Westlake, \xa0who time and time again have taken HYPE students from across Los Angeles, guided their pursuit of educational excellence and produced students who live and learn with integrity and purpose beyond themselves. HYPE would not be the success it is today without the support and partnership of Harvard-Westlake, its alumni and the HYPE students that have excelled on its campus. \nPlease join us in Downtown Los Angeles to celebrate Harvard Westlake as well as three other change-makers who are creating transformative change in Los Angeles.  \nThis Year\u2019s Honorees: \nHarvard-Westlake- \xa02015 HYPE Independent School Excellence Award \nL.A.

Better get in here. \nYou\u2019ve already spent enough time not looking at it. \nWe invite you to join us to explore the new world of Clifton\u2019s - a world of adventure, imagination and magic. \n \n\xa0CLIFTON\u2019S\xa0 \n648 S. Broadway,\xa0Los Angeles CA 90014 \nSecond, on our bar crawl is a visit to Little Easy.\xa0 \nLet\u2019s go ahead and start Mardi Gras\u2013ing tonight! \nLet the bons temps roll at Little Easy, a scenic new bar evoking a French Quarter manor, now open at Downtown\u2019s Alexandria Hotel under the Down & Out/Two Bits crew. \nJust step off 5th Street into a picturesque parlor of damask wallpaper with a stuffed, upright alligator facing the L-shaped bar.\xa0 Feels a lot like... well, you know.\xa0 New Orleans is what they\u2019re going for.\xa0 Good place for a bunch of friends to get together. Now go ahead and order Vieux Carr\xe9s, Sazeracs, gumbo and Abita-braised brisket here.\xa0 Here\u2019s made for doing that. \nThen you\u2019ll navigate a twisty hallway into the former shell of the Gorbals.\xa0 Which now looks all Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\u2013y.\xa0 Gurgling fountain in the center. Soul music everywhere. Patio porch swing to the left. Red-curtained bordello scene on the right.\xa0 Grab a seat on either side. \nAnd then... anything goes.\xa0 If you want po\u2019boy sliders, that can happen. \nIf you want beignets, that can happen. \nMan.\xa0 New Orleans\u2013themed bars are crazy. \n \nTHE LITTLE EASY\xa0 \n216 West 5th St.,\xa0Los Angeles, CA \nThird, on our bar crawl is a visit to Mrs. Fish.\xa0 \n(LIVE MUSIC!) \nTypical aquariums: a couple fish behind glass. Maybe one of those little castle things. \nDowntown aquariums: well, they wind through ceilings of massive underground bars. \nLike at Mrs. Fish, a spectacular new three-level basement bar filled with bands, tequila coladas and caviar-slathered toast points under a winding ceiling aquarium. \nKind of a mindblower here.\xa0 Just descend the elegant wrought-iron staircase off the sidewalk into the Pershing Square Building\u2019s basement (far, far below Perch, from the same owners) and you\u2019ll notice the snaking network of aquariums over your head. One tends to notice stuff like that. \nIf you\u2019re getting to know some attractive new Downtowners... find a flaming, on-draft Old Fashioned at the huge L-shaped bar. It\u2019s right by the stage. Oh, yes, there\u2019s a stage. \nIf you\u2019re with friends who like nutmeg-dusted tequila... head to the mezzanine\u2019s cowhide-draped nook for fishbowl-size snifters of El Caminos(they\u2019re like nutmeg-dusted tequila coladas), osetra caviar and Angry Inch Wagyu mini dogs. \nIf you tend to judge bands by their footwear... there\u2019s a CBGB-ish lower level with seats putting you at eye level with the base of the stage. Also, there\u2019s a drumming gorilla. \nOf course there\u2019s a drumming gorilla. \n \nMRS. FISH \n448 S Hill St,\xa0Los Angeles, CA \nFourth, on our bar crawl is a visit to Continental Club.\xa0 \n (DJ & DANCING!) \nThe Continental Club - a dark, sexy, hidden experience unlike anything we've seen to date. It's pure noir in the best sense of the word and is an ode to the sophistication and history now characterizing Downtown's Historic Core and in particular, the now revitalized block at 4th and Spring Street. \nMaking your way down to the basement of the famed Continental Building (est.1908) and entering The Continental Club is like stepping into another world. There are no signs, no images online, and no marketing. \nThe Continental Club. Opened quietly on February 6 by Ashley Joyce (The Room, Barcopa) and John Lasker, the lounge follows a similar approach of modern speakeasy tucked in an alleyway next to Bar Ama.\xa0 As for the aesthetic, think mid-century London member's only club fused with Havana and Vegas. \nTouting a more substantial cocktail service, like the Perfect Manhattan (rye, both dry and sweet vermouth, scorched orange oil) and the Gordon's Cup. \n \nCONTINENTIAL CLUB \n116 West 4th Street,\xa0Los Angeles, CA \n\xa0 \nFOR ACCESS TO THIS EVENT...\xa0 \n\xa0YOU MUST JOIN & RSVP THROUGH THIS LINK! \n\xa0YOU MUST JOIN & RSVP THROUGH THIS LINK! \nFood and drink is at your own expense. \n\xa0 \nFriday, October 30, 2015 from\xa0 8:00 PM \u2013 Midnight \n\xa0\xa0 \nParking: \xa0 \n*There is street parking and there are several lots nearby.

What started as a personal project for a group of \xa0teachers at Johnnie Cochran Middle School in Council District 10, has spread to a city-wide program that is fundamentally changing the lives of talented low-income students throughout Los Angeles. This could not have happened without the vision and resources of change-making individuals and programs that have helped HYPE become the organization it is today.  \nThis year, we\u2019d like to honor one of our independent school partners, Harvard-Westlake, \xa0who time and time again have taken HYPE students from across Los Angeles, guided their pursuit of educational excellence and produced students who live and learn with integrity and purpose beyond themselves. HYPE would not be the success it is today without the support and partnership of Harvard-Westlake, its alumni and the HYPE students that have excelled on its campus. \nPlease join us in Downtown Los Angeles to celebrate Harvard Westlake as well as three other change-makers who are creating transformative change in Los Angeles.  \nThis Year\u2019s Honorees: \nHarvard-Westlake- \xa02015 HYPE Independent School Excellence Award \nL.A.

    'description': u ' \nMt. Everest Avalanche Survivor Shares His Collection of Stunning Images \nKuntal Joisher will share his photo collection, \u201cNepal Himalaya: A Journey Through the Kingdom of Snow and Ice\u201d and be in attendance to share his stories of survival on Mt. Everest. The event will sell photo prints to raise money for the rebuilding of Nepal. Proceeds from this event will support the Nepal Youth Foundation. \nTHIS IS A FREE, ALL AGES EVENT. \nCelebrated mountaineer and photographer Kuntal Joisher is traveling from his home in Mumbai, India to Los Angeles and Orange County for a tour of fundraisers and events that will support the rebuilding of Nepal in the wake of April\u2019s devastating earthquake. \nKuntal Joisher was in midst of the 2015 avalanche on Mt. Everest, and featured in the video that went viral across the world with 23 million views on YouTube (see the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JC_wIWUC2U. More than 18 people died and over 70 were injured. Joisher survived the avalanche and stayed alive to tell the story. However, this was not a mountain climbing tragedy; it was a tragedy of unprecedented levels. Over nine and half thousand people died in Nepal, tens of thousands were serious injured, and more than half a million were displaced from their homes and continue living in temporary shelters today.\xa0 \n\xa0 \nKuntal Joisher, Biography \nKuntal Joisher combines the distinction of being an avid and a passionate mountaineer as well as a high end computer science and engineering professional. He has scaled some of the toughest and tallest mountains of the world. Alumni of USC Viterbi School of Engineering, today he juggles his IT career and his passion for mountain exploration, becoming only the second Indian civilian, and the first Vegan to climb and summit Mt. Manaslu, the 8th highest mountain in the world. Joisher is also an accomplished photographer and many of his photographic conquests have received International acclaim including National Geographic, Flickr Explore, BBC Earth, Himalayan Journal, and the reputed Indian mountaineer magazine. Joisher has completed several challenging and exciting mountain expeditions in the Himalaya of Nepal and India, Chilean Patagonia, and the Western Ghats near Mumbai. Joisher first visited Nepal as a child at the age of 4, and since then has returned six times as a member of international mountain climbing teams. Forever passionate and irrepressible in his goal, he continues to focus on his goal along with a serious fitness training regime to climb Mt. Everest in 2016. He continues to raise awareness for the causes of Dementia and veganism, the intrinsic and core values of his passionate and towering journey to climb Everest and many more lofty heights! \n\xa0 \nThe Avalanche \nIn April 2014, Kuntal Joisher was part of a 10 member international team led by famous mountaineering guide Tim Rippel from Canada. The team was climbing Mt. Everest. On April 18th, an ice-avalanche swept through the upper parts of Khumbu ice-fall killing 16 Sherpa mountaineering guides. It was the single most deadly accident in the history of big mountain climbing. Joisher was supposed to be in the ice-fall on the same day; however his team had to cancel their trip at the last moment due to non arrival of some critical gear. Consequently Joisher never made it to the ice-fall and survived to share his experience. At the same time 16 of world\u2019s top Sherpa guides were lost in the avalanche, and a week later the mountain was deemed unsafe and the expedition was called off. \nIn October 2014, Joisher became the first Vegan to summit the eighth highest mountain of the world - Mt. Manaslu, located in Mansiri part of the Nepalese Himalayas. \xa0The name Manaslu, means "Mountain of the Spirit", comes from the Sanskrit word Manasa, meaning "intellect" or "soul". \nIn April 2015, Joisher returned to Nepal. This time around he was the expedition leader of a strong team comprising of 8 international climbers attempting Mt. Everest via the South-east ridge route. On 25th April 2015, at 11.56 am a 7.9 earthquake struck Nepal. A huge avalanche triggered by the earthquake swept through the entire base camp. More than 18 people died and over 70 were injured. Joisher was in midst of the avalanche, and featured in the video that went viral across the world. Joisher survived the avalanche and stayed alive to tell the story. However, this was not a mountain climbing tragedy; it was a tragedy of unprecedented levels. Over nine and half thousand people died in Nepal, tens of thousands were serious injured, and more than half a million were displaced from their homes and continue living in temporary shelters today.\xa0 \n  ',

    'description': u 'Pico Union Project presents: the acclaimed one-woman show Rachel Calof for two performances in November. A memoir with music, Rachel Calof is the true story of a Jewish picture bride\u2019s astonishing life in pioneer North Dakota, starring actress Kate Fuglei. Adapted from Calof\u2019s autobiography by playwright Ken LaZebnik, with music and lyrics by Leslie Steinweiss, and directed by Ellen S. Pressman, Rachel Calof will be performed on November 6 and 7 at 7:30 p.m. at The Pico Union Project, 1153 Valencia Street, in Los Angeles.\xa0 \nRachel Calof (Kate Fuglei) immigrated from Russia to America in 1894 as a young mail-order bride, setting in Devils Lake, North Dakota, where she and and her husband Abe endured brutal winters in a 12 by 14 foot shack. For years, their shack was shared by her in-laws, a brother-in-law, two dozen chickens, and a cow. Nine children were born there, and Rachel\u2019s story is alternately funny, touching, and triumphant. This saga of a Jewish woman\u2019s survival on the American plains is an untold piece of history, brought to life in a brilliant performance by actress Kate Fuglei. ',

How can we be more inclusive, to better serve those within our organizations, classrooms, families, and personal interactions? This workshop aims to share essential knowledge, perspectives, and tools to address this - including samples from an instructional guide authored by Farzana Nayani, a multiethnic parent, educator, and Advisory Board Member for Multiracial Americans of Southern California (MASC). This session will also feature key multicultural resources to help facilitate the discussion within classrooms. \n\n  \n\u2022Student Empowerment: The Benefits of Cultural Capital \nby Tashiana Bryant: Coordinator, African American Student Center, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona \nThis session is based off of Dr. Tara Yosso\'s Community Cultural Wealth Model. Through the use of Critical Race Counterstories and the understanding of cultural capital in a communities of color, educators can empower students to utilize their cultural capital to succeed in their educational journey. According to Pierre Bourdieu, cultural capital refers an accumulation of cultural knowledge, skills and abilities possessed and inherited by privileged groups in society (Yosso, 2005). According to Yosso, cultural capital is not just inherited by the middle class. This session will explore Yosso explanation and how all communities can inherit cultural capital. During the session, I will introduce educators, administrators, and parents to Tara Yosso\'s work and provide examples of interventions that can be used to implement ideas in their institutions, homes, and communities to empower their students.  \n\n  \n\u2022Three Games to Start Conversations Around Race and Privilege \nby Cameron Coleman: Math Teacher, Diversity Council Chair, Brentwood School \nStarting authentic discussions about diversity topics with Middle Schoolers carries its own unique set of challenges. \xa0In this workshop, participants will hear about Cameron\'s experiences designing and conducting three kinesthetic games which have started authentic classroom discussions about race, and socioeconomic status. \xa0Tackling questions such as, "Are the Hunger Games Fair?" and "How Racist Is That?!", participants will receive resources which will help them recreate the games in their own classroom or assembly settings, show the pros and cons of gamifying these important topics. \n\xa0 \n\n  \n\u2022Unpacking the Colors of Communication \nby DimitriaCook: Leadership Coach,Better Boundaries Inc. \nAs educators, do you recognize the various subtle non-verbal cues students display in the classroom? As parents, do you know your daughters\u2019 long-term goals or your sons\u2019 short-term goals? How do our backgrounds color the messages we are sending and receiving in every conversation? A core component of effective communication is active listening. Attend Unpacking the Colors of Communication and become a better active listener when you communicate. You will participate in fun and engaging activities that help you improve communication with children. In addition, discover a more successful way to use a talking toy with elementary, middle school, and high school students in the classroom and at home. Communicating effectively builds trust and fosters respect that is something we all want in our relationships with others. Lastly, we will engage in an activity that delves into the subconscious reasons why and how we communicate and the filters others must get through to receive our verbal and non-verbal messages. Participants leave with a more productive way to use communication tools, gain a broader knowledge on how to communicate more effectively, and receive an enhanced understanding of three key components of effective communication. Participants will also have the opportunity to win various prizes, including a signed copy of my book, \u201cParents Playbook: Tips, Tweets, and Other Common Sense Advice.\u201d  \n\n  \n\u2022The Challenges and Successes of Sustaining a Parent Affinity Group at an Independent School \nby Tina Evans: Teacher & faculty liaison for the Parent Alliance of Students of African Descent (PASA), Brentwood school \nIndependent Schools have made significant progress in terms of diversifying their student bodies. However, being granted entry into an independent school is only the beginning of the hurdles faced by many students of color. How can parents of students of color advocate for their children to ensure both their academic success and cultural growth? This dynamic workshop will provide participants with an in-depth analysis of the formation, difficulties, and accomplishments of a parent affinity group at Los Angeles\' Brentwood School. Through a presentation by the faculty liaison and parent members, participants will gain a better understanding of the challenges associated with addressing the administration on issues of inclusion, and how to expand and identify goals and programming beyond Black History Month. \n\n  \n\u2022Our Place in the Sun: Creating and Sustaining a Program for Black Boys in Independent Schools \n\xa0by Rob Evans: Faculty, Chadwick School \n\xa0Our Place in the Sun: Creating and Sustaining a Program for Black Boys in Independent Schools is a learning and best practice workshops for educators and school leaders. We will discuss strategies for recruiting, supporting, and sustaining African American boys in independent schools. We will discuss the benefits, consequences, challenges, and successes of creating a targeted program of this nature.  \n\n  \n\u2022Portraits of a Black Girl (Documentary) Film Screening \nby Kena Dorsey: Administrator, TV Production, Faculty, Campbell Hall\xa0 \nThis is a screening of a 55 minute documentary film, which takes a look at the portrayals of African American women in todays media and society as told through the eyes of high school girls from a Los Angeles public and private school. The screening will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmaker. \n  \n \n\n  \n\u2022Parent and Education Policy; Cultivating Compassionate Individuals \n\xa0by Dr. Dena Scott: School Psychologist, Mirman School \n\xa0Current Intercultural Discussion Group (ICDG) Village Committee parents and faculty facilitate a discussion about how a parent-driven and administratively supported effort has bridged the cultural divide creating a weekly sanctuary for parents of all backgrounds to share experiences with candor and unusual vulnerability. Speaking with Dr. Scott are: Annabeth White and Odetta Watkins, Current Parent Coordinators \n  \n\n  \n  \n\u2022True Colors: An Inside Look at the Choices We Make  \n\nby David Maher, Teacher, Head of Upper Schools, Rolling Hills Prep and Renaissance Schools \n  \nEffective communication is key across all members of school communities. Often the barriers to communicating ideas and initiatives come from our own cultural and personal bias and the widely different ways we interpret the same information. This hands-on, activity based presentation uses the Hermann Brain Dominance Instrument to reveal the reasoning behind our own ways of seeing the world and how different they may be to the others around us.\xa0 \n \n\n\xa0 \n\n  \n\n  \n\u2022Top Ten Ways to Help Families and Staff of Color Feel Comfortable on Your Campus \nby Glenetta Pope, Teacher, Assistant Head For Teaching and Learning, Pluralistic School One \n  \nAs you look at the yearbook photos of the students and staff at each independent school, you will more than likely notice that there are none to few staff and students of color. My workshop will address how our schools can effectively recruit, embrace and support the families of color on our campuses. There will be simple, yet powerful advice shared from both the audience and the presenter.\xa0\n\n \n\n\xa0 \n\n  \n\n  \n\u2022Mindfulness: Teaching the Whole Student \nby Rebecca Ruberg, Ph.D., Director of Student Support and Psychologist, Chadwick School \n  \n\nRecently, the mindfulness movement has gained a lot of attention from various institutions all over the world including schools, health care facilities and thriving companies such as Google. In this session, mindfulness will be defined clearly and a curriculum of foundational mindfulness literacies will be introduced. This mindfulness curriculum is appropriate for K-12 students and information can be applied K-12. However, the emphasis will be on introducing mindfulness to an audience of adults (faculty, administrators, parents, heads, board members). We will explore how teaching mindfulness to others starts with teaching it to ourselves. This experiential session is designed to give the audience a glimpse into the benefits of mindfulness for both students and teachers. We will explore how mindfulness can be an effective vehicle to promote social-emotional learning, school climate, and diversity initiatives in independent schools. We will also explore the magic that can happen when we give our fast-paced school communities the space to recognize and reflect on their present moment awareness. We will explore how practicing mindfulness cultivates compassion for the self and others. The connection between mindfulness and social justice will also be highlighted. Research and brain science will be integrated into the session as well.\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0 \n\n  \n\n  \n\u2022Suspects and Saboteurs: Examining Issues of Internalized Racism Through the\xa0Eyes of Underrepresented Students in Independent Secondary Schools \nby Shellie P. Riley, "The Nerd Concierge" ,\xa0MA Ed. Leadership, MFA/JD UCLA\xa0 \nEducation Coach and Consultant Specializing In Professional Best Practices, Inclusion\xa0and Family Advocacy. \n\n\nWhat would prompt a teenager of color to confide in an African-American teacher, "The\xa0Black kids think you hate us"?\xa0Through play, inquiry and reflection we strip down to \u201cIdentity\xa0skivvies\u201d and expose how\xa0racial,\xa0cultural, gender or class presumptions color our personal histories but may impede\xa0our mission of inclusion and diversity. As we deconstruct our personal narratives we\xa0enhance consciousness of the vulnerable and volatile adolescent population. This\xa0proactive work is intended to shake up our default perceptions and activate strategies that\xa0discern differentiation from discrimination. \xa0Follow The Golden Rule? Think again.\xa0Leave your nametag and school affiliation at the door. \n\n \n\n\n\u2022LGBTQQIAA2S...huh? Understanding & Supporting sexuality and gender diverse communities \nby Raja G. Bhattar, Director, UCLA LGBT Campus Resource Center \n  \n\nAs sexual and gender identities become more prevalent in our schools, it is our responsibility to understand the experiences and needs of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) students, staff, teachers, parents and more. National media has given significant coverage to anti-LGBTQ bullying, harassment, violence and it\'s impact on student/staff resiliency. This session will provide an overview of LGBTQ communities, provide self-reflective practices and effective strategies for building inclusive spaces and institutional practices to ensure safety for this vulnerable population.\xa0\n\n \n\n\n\xa0 \n\n\u2022What\'s the word: Microagressions \nby Aleisha Lander, M.A.\xa0, Psy. D Marital and Family Therapy Student\xa0, The Chicago School of Professional Psychology \n\n\xa0 \nThis session will look to identify what Microagressions are, how common they are, common communities victim of Microagressions, along with some examples of Microagressions.\xa0\n \n\n\xa0 \n\xa0 \n\xa0 \n\n\u2022Am I diverse? Identity Exploration and Development \nby Dana Gonzalez MA, Diversity Coordinator/Grade Level Dean, Viewpoint School \n  \nEveryone is diverse! Even those that fall within what would be considered your school\'s normative culture bring something unique. Come explore different identity models and learn the ways in which you dibersify your community.\xa0 \n\n \n\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0 \n\n\nSTUDENT CURRICULUM\n\n\xa0\n*Meaningful peer discussions on privilege, diversity & inclusion.\n \n*How to improve cross cultural communication.\xa0\n\xa0\n*Identity & self exploration.\n\xa0\n*Race, ethnicity, national origin.\n\xa0\n*Opportunities to share with adult participants their Across Colors Experience.\n\xa0\n*Core cultural identifiers.\n\xa0\n*Networking and relationship building with other independent school students.\n \n<div style="font-size: 13',

    'description': u "It's one of the most well-known places in the world. But much has changed since the first HOLLYWOODLAND letters were first erected over the Beachwood Canyon in 1923, including the transformation of the surrounding neighborhood into a world-famous tourism destination. Over the past few years, technology has made it easier and more alluring to reach the sign, leading to disputes between hikers, residents, tourists, historians, preservationists, public space proponents, pedestrian advocates, and government officials over how the sign and the spaces around it should be used. \nThis free, public walk through Beachwood Canyon to the Hollywood Sign will tour some of the popular viewing areas as well as paths to the sign and highlight several public access challenges. Guest speakers, including local residents, will meet us along the way to share their ideas for how access might be improved. At the end of the hike, at noon,\xa0we'll meet at a shaded spot for a discussion and miniature charrette to prototype some basic ideas for improving access to the sign and Griffith Park in general. \nThis is a fairly strenuous three-mile hike with steep hills, several staircases, and dusty trails. Please wear closed-toed shoes, bring sunblock and hats, and carry enough water. Please also note there are few bathrooms (none of which are public). The Beachwood Market opens at 8am if you need to purchase anything that morning. \nWe'll meet out front of Beachwood Market and do a three-mile loop, ending back at the market. Please be aware of parking restrictions in the area. Unfortunately the DASH does not run on Sunday, but please consider carpooling or using on-demand ride services. It is a 35-minute walk or 5-minute cab ride from the Hollywood and Vine Metro station. \n \n\nThis is the first event in our series\xa0Making LA: Connect, Flourish, Thrive, Prosper. Following up on our 2014\xa0Making LA conference, these events will look at issues in the areas of\xa0Transportation,\xa0Water,\xa0Density\xa0and\xa0Community\xa0with the\xa0goal of bringing designer- and artist-driven solutions to those issues to life. In this way, we hope to turn the original\xa0Making LA conference\xa0into a long-term call-to-action and turn in-person inspiration into four real-world solutions for the city. Making LA is made\xa0possible by support from the National Endowment for the Arts. Want to sponsor an upcoming event?\xa0Learn more. \n",

These presentations communicate sensitive information such as cultural values and beliefs and behavior patterns detrimental to the quality of life and health of the individual, in a visually engaging manner. This method of depicting "real life" experiences through theatrical presentations to raise awareness and provide information is an essential component of the organization\u2019s empowerment, leadership development, and community organizing efforts. It has proven effective for targeting Latina farmworker women with low rates of educational attainment and limited English literacy. \nThese theatrical presentations are scripted and performed by the campesinas themselves and are designed to establish confianza (trust) among the audience in order to later engage them in frank and open dialogue. The dialogue reflects the actual vocabulary and idioms of the Latina/o farmworker community, and the topic they are targeting. \nMorning Break \n10:15 a.m. \u2013 10:30 a.m. \nBreakout sessions (pre-registration required) \n10:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. \nMaking the Criminal Justice System Accessible to Underserved Victims\nPanelists\nMegan Riker-Rheinschild, Victim Advocate, Santa Barbara County Victim Witness Center  Oaxacan, Migrant Populations \nRonnetta Johnson, Victim Advocate, Community Services Program, Orange County  Gang Violence \nKay Buck, Executive Director, Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (CAST)  Human Trafficking \nPeggie Reyna, Project Director, Deaf, Disabled, and Elder Services  People with Disabilities \nDescription\nNavigating the criminal justice system can be a very difficult and confusing experience for victims of crime.

Azim is a rare individual who not only speaks of powerful and life-changing concepts, but also walks his talk. Before audiences of the young and adult, as well as the public and the corporate, Azim delves deeply into hearts and souls, inspiring hope, courage and personal growth, along with providing steps to join him on the journey of peace and purpose. Azim carries the message that peace can be restored, no matter what has gone before. In the end audiences are inspired with a life-changing story of redemption, forgiveness and personal power through purpose-driven action. \nClosing Remarks \n4:45 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ',

    'description': u 'Tuesday, August 25th at 7:00pm | No Charge \n\u201cBy taking certain actions on Rosh Hashanah, and using specific tools, we can discard from our lives all disruptions, yielding a change for the better in the New Year\u2019s script. Without these tools we would be subject to the verdict that is directly correlated with our past deeds.\u201d \u2014 Rav Berg\xa0  Rosh Hashanah is the first important step along the path of the 22 days of transformation that are available to us at the beginning of the month of Tishrei. The tools available to us include the window of time itself, the Shofar, Prayer, Mediation and Consciousness. Each year we unite as a community of like-minded people in order to work individually and collectively to create a year that brings us closer to who we are meant to be. \nABOUT DE-CODING SERIES:\xa0In the early days of the Kabbalah Centre our teacher Rav Berg would reveal the inner essence of the holidays \u2013 from the Zohar, sharing what he learned from his teacher, and his teacher\u2019s teacher, using the decryption tool of numerology, and referencing the original source language of Hebrew and Aramaic from the writings of the ancient kabbalists. The Kabbalah Centre\u2019s DE-CODING series is evocative of these profound studies. These lectures will provide us with deeper and more profound knowledge and therefore a greater ability to connect to the energy that exists during these days of power, energy that was pre-programmed into the universe since the dawn of time, now made accessible not for any one group of people but for all of humankind. \nIf you have questions, please feel free to call: 310-657-5404 ',

We hope you will join GABBCON and our partners C-Suite Network, Hulu, NBC, CBS, Fox, IPG, Omnicom, RPA, Clorox, SpotX, Tivo, TubeMogul, DataXu plus many more, as we get together in Los Angeles to tackle these and other important topics; \n  \n\nHow can the industry possibly keep up with the changes if the industry does not have common definitions?\xa0 Join your delegate partners and speakers in an interactive session on the common terms and phrases that confuse the industry the most. GABBCON and our partners will help reshape your vocabulary on key terms and phrases.  \nHow will the DSP as we know it survive in TV and Premium Video?

Principles of the MFCI are: \n\nNormalcy of Childbirth\nEmpowerment\nResponsibility\nDo No Harm\nAutonomy\n\n  \nAudience \nPhysicians, Midwives, Doulas, Nurses, Childbirth Educators, Academics, Researchers, Funders,\xa0 Public Health Professionals, Community Perinatal Health Workers, and others. \n\xa0 \nConference Objectives  \n1) Discuss the benefits of the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative (MFCI) which was developed by The Coalition for Improving Maternity Services for hospitals, clinics, mothers, infants, and clinicians. \n2) Provide a forum for discussion among nurses, doctors, doulas, childbirth educators, midwives, administrators and others on the challenges and opportunities of implementing mother-friendly care in the clinical or hospital setting. \n3) Provide a forum for dissemination of evidence-based best practices for maternity care. \n4) Support clinics, hospitals and community-based programs in developing plans of action to shift the thinking in their organizations towards mother-friendly care and develop multidisciplinary coordinated networks\xa0 of maternity care providers. \n5) Practitioners and students of maternity care will obtain an objective understanding of the collision of worldviews and belief systems when the medical and midwifery models of maternity care intersect. \n6) Participants will describe how the perinatal community as a whole can best collaborate to provide optimal care for mothers and infants based on the principals of the MFCI and the evidence-based practices available as outlined in the 10 steps of the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative (MFCI). \n \nCONFERENCE THEMES  \n \xa0Equity in Maternal-Child Health \nSessions under this theme will explore the underlying causes of health inequities and disparities for vulnerable mothers and infants including racism, poverty, geography, ethnicity. Research, best practices and innovations to deliver interventions aimed at reducing\xa0 maternal and infant mortalities and morbdities will be described. Speakers will share strategies to address gaps in equity and promote justice in maternity care. \n\xa0 \nRespectful Treatment in Maternity Care \nSessions under this theme will address cultural and systemic barriers to providing humane and respectful maternity care. Using a human rights framework, speakers will discuss issues such as informed consent and refusal, right to privacy, autonomy, and freedom of choice. Strategies for cross-cultural communication between caregivers and clients and between practitioners will be addressed. \n\xa0 \nProfessional Collaboration in Maternity Care \nSessions under this theme will provide a forum for Maternal-Infant Health care providers from various discliplines to discuss strategies for bridging the gap when worldviews and models of maternity care--technocratic, humanistic, holistic (Davis-Floyd)--collide. Opportunities for ongoing communication will inspire allied perinatal health professionals to create harmonious teams committed to promoting the health and well-being of mothers and newborns. \n\xa0 \nPromoting Normalcy of Birth and Breastfeeding \nSessions under this theme will promote physiological childbirth and breastfeeding, protecting the motherinfant-dyad even when complications arise. Research and empirical knowledge will be shared about the innate abilities of mothers and newborns to survive and thrive. The impact of childbirth practices on breastfeeding and maternal mental health are explored in these sessions. Spirituality as a coping strategy in childbirth and compassion as a part of a caregiver\'s toolkit will also be discussed in these sessions.  \n  \n\xa0 \n\n  \nMEET OUR SPEAKERS  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \nTatiana Rubio, Lic.

    'description': u 'In this day long we ask the critical question-- how can our identity as white people help us awaken? How do we hold the suffering in our lives, and in the world?\xa0 Let us explore what freedom looks like for us and how we can engage with the calls for racial justice sweeping across the United States.\xa0 With great attention to the movement of our hearts, we will explore through meditation, dharma talks and guided conversations how we bring ourselves to wholeness in a life in the dharma. \nTeachers \nArinna Weisman is the founding teacher of Insight Meditation Center of the Pioneer Valley and Lotus\xa0Sisters, Seattle. She is co-author of A Beginner\'s Guide to Insight Meditation, and was the first\xa0teacher to lead retreats for the Lgbtq gender queer community.\xa0Her teaching is infused with her\xa0political activism.\xa0 \nTrudy Goodman, PHD is the founder of InsightLA and is currently the senior Vipassana teacher in\xa0Los Angeles. \nDiana Winston is the Director of Mindfulness Education at UCLA\'s Mindful Awareness Research\xa0Center, and on the Teachers Council at Spirit Rock Meditation Center. She is the author of \u201cFully\xa0Present: The Science, Art, and Practice of Mindfulness\u201d and \u201cWide Awake: A Buddhist Guide for\xa0Teens.\u201d \nNoah Levine is the founder of Against the Stream and the author of "Dharma Punx", "Against the\xa0Stream", "Heart of the Revolution" and "Refuge Recovery." \n  \nLocation \nThe \u201cMindful and White\u201d daylong retreat will be held at 1001a Colorado Avenue, between 10th and 11th (click here for map). \xa0 \nThis is the Santa Monica home of Against the Stream and was formerly used by the Santa Monica Zen Center. \xa0The entrance to the meditation center is in the alley that runs behind the Writer\u2019s Junction. \xa0The building is shared with the Writer\u2019s Junction who have a big sign and are on the corner of 10th and Colorado. Please don\u2019t bother them as there is no access from there. We are on the other side of the building, in the alley, behind the brick wall. \xa0 \nParking \nIf a ten minute walk (approximately 8 blocks) is all right with you, there is easy to locate public parking at the Santa Monica Main Library Public Parking Lot,\xa01350 7th St,\xa0Santa Monica, CA 90405. \xa0The maximum daily fee for Sundays is $5.00. \xa0 \nBecause of the light rail construction on Colorado, there are no longer meters on Colorado. There are meters on Broadway and free parking along the side streets. Please be careful parking on the side streets and make sure you read all posted signs. There are some restrictions on the residential streets. \nDO NOT PARK in the alley by the entrance; your car WILL BE TOWED. We do not have any spaces available in the alley so you should not park there.\xa0 \nFood \nWe recommend that you bring your lunch due to time constraints. \xa0We plan to allocate one hour for lunch between\xa012.30 and 1.30 pm. \xa0Hot water for tea will be provided. \nIf you are unable to bring your lunch there is Bay Cities Italian Deli (1517 Lincoln Blvd) and a Von\u2019s with a Starbucks inside (710 Broadway) both\xa0within walking distance.

His words from spirit will make you laugh, make you cry and take your breath away. \n This will be a night remember. We expect that this event will sell out, so book in advance and join us to witness the incredible talent that the Hollywood Reporter called the \u201cpsychic with the A+ batting average." \n From an audience member at Thomas\'s most recent event: "I think I left my jaw on the floor of the theater last night, so if you find it let me know. I\'ve never experienced anything or anyone like that! Thomas is beyond gifted and spot on. It was truly life changing and absolutely shifted my consciousness. God came in and opened my mind and heart." --Zita B. \n PARKING: There is some parking directly in front of the theater. When that lot becomes full, you\'ll need to look for street parking nearby. \n The theatre is handicapped accessible. \n\xa0 \n\xa0 ',

    'description': u "TICKETS \nIf we don't sell out, tickets will be available at the door. \nTHE SHOW \nThis is the seventh in a series of fundraising concerts organized to pay for the defunded music education program at Castelar Elementary School. Established in 1882 and sitting right in the middle of Chinatown, the inner-city campus serves mostly immigrant kids who don't get much exposure to performing arts or creative outlets. Chinatown has an unbeatable musical past (mostly punk) and rad art scene in the present (post punk). Neither crowd crosses paths often with the residents in Chinatown but we're trying to create a bridge for them to help out the local kids. \nThis special bill will include: \n\u2022 Sean Wheeler & Zander Schloss - Gnarled and raw but unironic and honest gospel and blues by way of punk bars and AA folding chairs rather than church pews. Lineage includes Throw Rag, Circle Jerks, Thelonious Monster, Joe Strummer, Thelonious Monster, The Weirdos... \u2022 Upset - Perfectly punky pop with rough edges, sweet melodies, and smart lyrics with a killer pedigree that includes Best Coast, Vivian Girls, La Sera, and Hole.  \u2022 California - Understated, melodic, and rootsy post indie punk 'n' roll featuring Jason from Green Day, Pinhead Gunpowder, and Monsula; Adam from Jawbreaker and J Church; and Dustin from The Insides. \u2022 Rachel Haden - A rare show featuring a beloved member of That Dog and the Haden Triplets taking center stage to play her own songs. \u2022 Steve Soto - A special acoustic set by the member of Adolescents, Agent Orange, Legal Weapon, Manic Hispanic, and 22 Jacks. \u2022 Plus special guest DJ set by Atomic Nancy using 45s from the legendary Atomic Cafe. \nThat's a killer bill for 12 lousy bucks (and maybe some raffle tickets). \nTHE RAFFLE \nIn addition to donating for admission, guests will be able to donate money toward raffle tickets for a chance to score prizes. $1 = 1 ticket. So far, and it's still early, prizes include the following: \n\u2022 One pair of shoes from Keep Company \u2022 Goodies from Frontier/Dangerhouse Records \u2022 Postpunk/goth mix tape from Jawseybruce Records  \u2022 Gift certificate from Purgatory Pizza  \u2022 Gift certificate from Scoops Chinatown \u2022 Gift certificate from Kumquat baby clothes \u2022 Chinatown zines by Allister Wong/BIB  \u2022 Rock 'n' roll goodies from Berndt Offerings \u2022 Meat Puppets CDs signed by Cris Kirkwood \u2022 My Life as a Jerk DVD signed by Keith Morris \u2022 Hand-finished metal art Joe Strummer stars by Mike Magrann of Channel Three.  \u2022 Brand-new Save Music in Chinatown: The First Two Years zine   \u2022 Save Music in Chinatown: The First Two Years mixtape \nCheck this site regularly for additions as the show draws nearer, and contact us if you'd like to donate something cool to the cause! \nSET TIMES \nSorta, maybe... Not set in stone but just so you can plan your day.    2:00 - 2:30 - DJ set by Atomic Nancy  2:30 - 2:50 - Rachel Haden  3:00 - 3:50 - California  4:00 - 4:50 - Upset  5:00 - 5:20 - Steve Soto  5:30 - 6:20 - Sean Wheeler & Zander Schloss \nPARKING \nThere is free metered parking on the streets (try going north on Broadway) and pretty cheap parking on College. \nMISC. \nAll ticket proceeds minus surcharges will be donated directly to FACES (Friends and Alumni of Castelar Elementary School, a registered nonprofit organization) to be applied specifically to the music education program.

    'description': u "Chroma Coalition II | October 10th, 2015 \nLos Angeles' Premier Body Painting Art Exhibit for Artists by Artists\xa0 \n\n\xa0 \nChroma is color. Coalition is unity.\xa0 \nTogether allowing artist to complete the spectrum of self-expression in the rawest form of beauty - body painting. A method to literally draw out one's inner beauty and create an outer body experience. And I repeat - literally.  Chroma Coalition brings together the most respected artists in the body painting industry to showcase the finest executions of living art. It starts with our collection of seasoned talent and it ends with you! For one day, everyone is a body painter and a living canvas.  Our mission was founded on one simple goal - to unite artist from all medias and pay homage to the art of exquisite body painting. Our message is firm. THE HUMAN BODY IS ART.\xa0  What makes us different from all of the other body painting events?  We are NOT a competition.\xa0 We are NOT a trade show determined to teach or sell.\xa0 We are NOT a public spectacle of distasteful nudity.\xa0  An elegant toast to the celebration of life, Chroma Coalition is a private curated art show, promoting key influential artist in the body painting industry to advocate the authenticity of its trade.\xa0  Each showcased artist is individually scouted one-by-one based on talent, expression and dedication within the body painting industry. Performances are live and staged as personal exhibits.  Ultimately, Chroma Coalition is an exhibit for artists by artists! Attendees are encouraged to embrace the full experience of body painting by choosing to paint and/or be painted at one our hosted paint stations. Everyone is welcome to take center stage in the grand finale. \n\n\xa0Register Today For Your FREE Ticket! ",

Andy Bales of the Union Rescue Mission (URM) for a 90-minute walking tour along the historic paths that have delineated Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.\xa0This tour derives from the ongoing 1947project\xa0In SRO Land\xa0blog series that uses the archives of the URM (founded 1891) as a tool for exploring the social and architectural history of the forgotten people and places of Downtown Los Angeles.\xa0 \nThe tour begins with a survey of the early history of the outreach by the URM through its gospel wagon and at two now-lost buildings: the original home at 145 N. Main (now City Hall Lawn) and the long-time location at 226 S. Main (now a parking lot next to the former St. Vibiana\u2019s Cathedral). \nThe main themes will be the evolution of public policy on Skid Row from the private philanthropy of Lyman Stewart to today\u2019s Continuum of Care, the transformative work of the URM, and the architectural history of the neighborhood. \nThe route will include Main Street between 2nd and 3rd Streets (for a then/now comparison of the surviving and demolished locations featured in the 1949 URM-financed short film\xa0Of Scrap & Steel,\xa0which will be screened later in the evening in a\xa0free event that requires a separate reservation). At 3rd and San Pedro Streets we will discuss the\xa0Azusa Street Revival, a transformative event in the spiritual history of Los Angeles and the West. During the walk back to the current home of the URM, Rev. Andy Bales will talk about issues and challenges facing the neighborhood and the URM today. ',

    'description': u 'Event Page  \nLAVA \u2013 The Los Angeles Visionaries Association is pleased to announce a free roof-top screening of a newly-discovered circa 1949 short color film of Main Street and other downtown Los Angeles locations, the Union Rescue Mission-produced Of Scrap & Steel. The screening is in conjunction with a series of downtown stories on the In SRO Land time travel blog, featuring material from the Union Rescue Mission Archives. \nABOUT THE FILM: In mid-1948 the Board of Directors of the Union Rescue Mission approved the expenditure of $5,000 to make the 30-minute film Of Scrap & Steel which portrays the redemption and good works of Arthur Hawkins, an alcoholic executive who ended up on the streets of Los Angeles and whose life was saved when he turned to the URM for help. Porter Hall (Arthur Hawkins) is one of only two actors in a film otherwise populated by real Los Angeles characters. (You may recall Hall\u2019s performance as the pesky guy on the train in Double Indemnity.) \nOf Scrap & Steel was only shown in screenings organized by the URM or related organizations, and would have been completely lost if Liz Mooradian, URM historian, had not saved a deteriorating 16mm print and had it transferred to video before it was too late. Of Scrap & Steel is just one of the remarkable artifacts discovered in the Union Rescue Mission archives and explored in the In SRO Land blog. \nThis entertaining and powerful short film is a compelling snapshot of life on Skid Row (Main Street) circa 1949, and a fascinating document of the important work that the URM continues to do with the most needy in the community. Although downtown Los Angeles features in numerous noir films, it is extremely rare to see color images of eastern downtown, and rarer still to see full-color live-action footage of the vibrant street scene that included rescue missions, pawn shops, amusement parlors, bars, restaurants and the ever-patrolling paddy wagon in search of drunkards to haul away to jail or County work crews. \nThis free rooftop screening is jointly organized by LAVA\u2013The Los Angeles Visionaries Association, the In SRO Land time travel blog and the Union Rescue Mission. Attendees are encouraged to dress warmly for the cool night air. Refreshments with be provided compliments of URM. \nThis screening is held in conjunction with the Skid Row Walking Tour, a separate free event beginning two hours before the screening. Separate registration for each event is required if you wish to attend both the screening and walking tour. \nNearest Metro station is Little Tokyo. \nLimited free parking is available at the URM\u2019s underground parking lot. Just tell the attendant you are there for the film. Please carpool: if each guest arrives with one other person in their car, there should be enough parking for all. Those arriving later will have to leave their keys with the parking attendant. \nIn addition, there will be overflow parking in the San Julian parking lot located just behind the URM, on San Julian Street between 5th & 6th Streets, on the east side of the street, adjacent to URM. Registered attendees will be able to enter the URM from the Women\u2019s entrance on San Julian. There will be ample staff to direct you from the lot to this entrance. \nIn the event of rain, we will screen the film in the Chapel. \nSchedule \n6pm - Doors open (reserved guests check in at the main entrance and are sent up to the roof) \n7pm-7.30pm - Refeshments, guests can watch the sunset (7:45pm) \n7.30pm -Rev. Andy Bales (URM), Nathan Marsak (1947project), Richard Schave (Esotouric) and Prof. Paul Rood (BIOLA) will introduce the film in the context of the neighborhood\u2019s history, and their work on the In SRO Land time travel blog, and a brief introduction to the life and legacy of the URM\u2018s founder, Lyman Stewart. \n8pm - Film screening \n8.30pm - Q & A \n9pm - Event ends ',

    'description': u '\xa0 \nThe Annual Baseball Medicine Conference was initiated by Dr. Lewis A. Yocum in 1987 in order to provide a venue for continuing education primarily for athletic trainers and therapists involved in baseball sports medicine. This meeting quickly became one of the most popular conferences of its kind among the PBATS community, as well as among trainers and therapists caring for baseball athletes of all levels. The meeting also became the true \u201cpride and joy\u201d of Lew Yocum\u2019s professional life.  \nAs a tribute to Lew\u2019s commitment to the continuing education of the dedicated professionals involved in baseball sports medicine, we are honored to continue this tradition and his beloved course in Lew\u2019s name.  \nWe are therefore proud to announce The First Annual Lewis A. Yocum, MD Memorial Baseball Medicine Conference, to be held November 20-22, 2015, at the JW Marriott LA Live in Los Angeles, California. The meeting will also be hosted at Dodger Stadium in honor of the late Frank W. Jobe, MD, recognizing his contributions to baseball sports medicine.  ',

Consequently, exterior cladding systems must be detailed to accommodate building movements, including vertical deflections and lateral displacements from wind, seismic, and other forces. This presentation will focus on the design of facade systems to accommodate structural displacement and is intended for design professionals, owners, and contractors. We will help project teams better understand how the building structure impacts the facade and discuss the challenges cladding and glazing assemblies face when accommodating movement. \n  \nAfter attending this presentation, participants will be able to: \n\n\nProvide an overview of facade assemblies and design requirements.\n\n\nDescribe how facade assemblies interact with the structure, particularly at corners.\n\n\nIdentify design solutions for joint and attachment detailing of facade systems to accommodate structure movement, including the corners.\n\n\nUnderstand methods for validating facade performance during structural movement.\n\n\n About the presenters:\nJonathan D. Hill, P.E. |\xa0Senior Staff II - Building Technology\xa0\xa0\nJon has over ten years of experience in the design, investigation, and construction contract administration of building envelope components and facade systems for major commercial, educational, and residential buildings. His projects encompass waterproofing consulting (including roofs, plaza areas, and below-grade spaces), as well as designing and reviewing cladding components, both standard and customized. Jon serves as chair of the LA Building Enclosure Council. Committed to using innovative methods to solve problems, he focuses on integrating the design, performance analysis, fabrication, and construction of building enclosures.\n\xa0\n\nJames C. Parker, S.E.| Senior\xa0Principal - Structures\n\n\nJames has thirty years of experience in both structural engineering and building enclosures. His work includes new structural design, investigation, and retrofit of existing buildings, and the design of high-performance building facades. James is the author of AISC Design Guide 22, Facade Attachments to Steel-Framed Buildings, and has presented an AISC lecture series on the Guide. He frequently lectures and writes about topics regarding lessons learned on design projects, building information modeling, seismic design, and current structural engineering issues. \n\xa0 \n\n\n\n\xa0 \n\n\xa0 \n\xa0\nSave the date for this upcoming SGH LA Seminar! \n\n\xa0\n\n10.22.2015\nRENEW, REFRESH, REPURPOSE:  Structural and Enclosure Considerations for  Modifying/Adapting Existing Buildings presented by Kevin O'Connell\xa0& Jud Taylor\n\n\n",

    'description': u "THE ANGEL CITY JAZZ FESTIVAL\xa0 \npresents \n8:00PM - World Premiere of Lisa Mezzacappa's GLORIOUS RAVAGE 9:30PM - MARK DRESSER QUINTET \n\xa0 \nGlorious Ravage is a panoramic free jazz song cycle by San Francisco Bay Area bassist and composer Lisa Mezzacappa, that features a large ensemble of stellar California improvisers performing new music in dialogue with films created by Bay Area moving image artists Janis Crystal Lipzin, Kathleen Quillian, Alfonso Alvarez and Konrad Steiner. The program takes as its inspiration the adventures and writings of lady explorers of the 19th century who trekked to the wildest parts of the earth, to escape, to discover, and to lose themselves. \n\xa0 \nThe act of playing the bass is home. It is the primal and primary vehicle of my musical identity. After several solo recordings that explore the musical investigation of extended techniques and electro-acoustic performance through structured improvisation and composition, Mark Dresser's quintet music has a somewhat different agenda. The quintet music is centered around a personal approach to the jazz tradition and song form: beauty of melody, counterpoint and harmony, swing, rhythmic invention and cyclical form. In addition I seek to integrate timbre sculpting, metric modulation, free meter and gradience, i.e. the blurring of boundaries between pitch and noise, meter and texture, form and feeling. Above all is the collaborative and improvisational power of the band that ultimately shapes the music. ",

    'description': u 'Drawing is one of the oldest forms of human expression: Over 30,000 years ago, artists drew herds of bison racing across the rock walls of Grotte Chavet. In more recent times, drawings were considered problem-solving exercises, with emphasis on observation and investigation; they were produced as preparation for the more privileged media of painting and sculpture. But today, many artists use drawing as their primary or only art form. "The Drawing Show" focuses on artists whose aesthetic practices focus on drawing. \n ABEL ALEJANDRE uses his consummate skill with graphite pencils to produce mural-scaled drawings that grapple with his identity and personal past. Mil Mascaras depicts the artist behind\xa0a devil mask from his native Michoacan, Mexico. A lacey bra hangs on one of the devil\'s horns, suggesting a sexual and perhaps illicit engagement. \xa0http://abelalejandre.com/ \n  \n JODI BONASSI creates surreal worlds that are densely populated by both human and spiritual entities. Her series of gun-themed drawings look at the affects of violence on children.\xa0http://www.jodibonassiart.com/ \n  \n NANCY BAKER CAHILL creates graphically powerful images of tightly woven abstract images. At times, she rips her drawings into petal-like shapes that are re-assembled into sculptural forms.\xa0http://nancybakercahill.com/  \n  \n SUSAN FELDMAN\'s drawings are extensions of her sculptural and installation work. For "The Drawing Show," she has created a string drawing that angles up the stairwell and is punctuated by claybord renderings of knots and tangles.\xa0http://susanfeldmanart.com/  \n  \n JOANNE JULIAN\'s oeuvre is based on Asian traditions, sometimes with specifically Zen iconography (i.e., the remarkable series of Zen Circles), and sometimes with spiritual attention to the natural world, whether it be birds or blossoms.\xa0http://www.joannejulian.com/home  \n  \n ECHIKO OHIRA creates drawings so subtle the viewer must slow down and spend quiet time to see them. Spirals echo in graphite silence, almost disappearing into the whiteness of the paper.\xa0  \n  \n MILO REICE allows the history of art to flow through him with expressive fervor. Figures are sketched and scribbled across horizontal bands, inviting viewers to imagine narrative interactions.\xa0http://miloreice.com/MiloReice/intro.html  \n  \n \n KENT TWITCHELL\'s famed murals are based on the precision of his portraits. For this exhibition, we have selected Twitchell\'s portrait studies of several famed individuals, from Olympic athletes to jazz singers to the woman who inspired one of his renowned freeway murals.\xa0http://www.kenttwitchell.org/ \n  \n J. MICHAEL WALKER portrays strong and beautiful women and the powerful spirits that watch over them, in his colored pencil drawings of Afro-Brazilians and the Orishas.\xa0www.jmichaelwalker.com/ \n\xa0 \n ANDRE YI\'s mixed media drawings of dead birds include pencil shavings, poured paint, and collage components--as well as precise graphite renderings.\xa0http://www.andreyi.net/   \n  \nExhibition Curator - Betty Ann Brown \nBetty Ann Brown is an art historian, critic, and curator. She has a Ph.D. in the History of Art and teaches at Cal State Northridge and Pasadena City College. \nBrown has curated several major exhibitions, including retrospectives for Hans Burkhardt, Roland Reiss, Linda Vallejo, and John White; as well as themed exhibitions addressing alternative families, community, and environmental issues. She has written dozens of critical essays, for Arts, Artscene, and Artweek; as well as numerous exhibition catalogues, for Don Bachardy, Merion Estes, Susan Feldman, Cheri Gaulke, Joanne Julian, Joan Kahn, Meg Madison, and Kim Yasuda, among others. Brown\u2019s books include Exposures, Women & Their Art (1989); Expanding Circles: Women, Art & Community (1996); Gradiva\u2019s Mirror: Reflections on Women, Surrealism & Art History (2002); the online textbook Art & Mass Media (2005); Hero, Madman, Criminal, Victim: The Artist in Film & Fiction (2009); and Afternoons with June: Stories of June Wayne\u2019s Art & Life (2012). \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \nBrown was featured in four History Channel programs, did a series of discussions about art history for eHow online, and was recently interviewed on KPFK. She organizes of \u201cContemporary Art Conversations,\u201d an ongoing series of panel discussions between critics and artists that convenes in various Southern California venues. \n\xa0 ',

He has received numerous Best Restaurant, Best Chef, and Best Service awards, and in 2013 received the Humanitarian of the Year Award from the James Beard Foundation for his work through the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, which supports children's educational programs. The author of 18 cookbooks, his phenomenally successful Food Network show Emeril Live! launched a new era in culinary TV. In 2014, Lagasse participated in his third consecutive season as a main guest chef on Bravo's hit food series, Top Chef, and joined TNT as co-host for their cooking series, On the Menu. Most recently, Emeril's Florida entered its third season in January 2015 on the Cooking Channel.\xa0 \nIn Essential Emeril, Lagasse\xa0goes back to basics, presenting more than 130 recipes that defined his award-winning career, each tested and perfected for today's home cook. Dishes such as Crab and Corn Fritters with Fresh Corn Mayo, Roasted Portuguese Pork Loin With Potatoes and Homemade Pimenta Moida, and White Chocolate Bread Pudding With Toasted Macadamia Caramel Sauce reflect a lifetime of lessons in technique, showcasing the big flavor for which he is known and his continued evolution in the kitchen. Emeril offers valuable tips and step-by-step photo tutorials to ensure flawless results. \nThe book includes\xa0Emeril's anecdotes revealing the inspiration behind each recipe, with appearances from A-list names - Mario Batali, Roy Choi, and Nobu Matsuhira, to name a few - alongside family members and early influences such as Julia Child and Charlie Trotter. \n\xa0 \nClassically trained chef\xa0Roy Choi\xa0is a culinary street revolutionary. He brings together the high and the low \u2013 deliciously, passionately, and socially. While his pedigree includes Le Bernardin and the Beverly Hilton, his fame rose with one amazing taco that tastes like L.A. \u2013 and nearly single-handedly created the gourmet food truck movement with his partners on the wings of Twitter.\n\xa0 \n\nBefore hitting the streets with his popular food truck Kogi BBQ, Choi executed classical techniques in professional kitchens and banquet halls for twelve years in New York, San Francisco, Portland, and Lake Tahoe. Then came the Great Recession. Laid off, having lost everything, with a family to support, Choi had to get creative: He said yes to a friend who rented a truck and co-founded Kogi BBQ, which\xa0Newsweek\xa0later dubbed \u201cthe first viral eatery.\u201d\xa0 \nChoi provided yet another source of culinary revelation with his first sit-down restaurant, Chego in April 2010, now located in Chinatown, followed by A-Frame in 2010, and Sunny Spot just east\xa0of\xa0Venice Beach in 2011. His newest\xa0restaurant venture, featuring the tastes of Korea translated through an L.A. state of mind, opened at a new hotel, The Line, in L.A. in late 2013. Choi\u2019s first book,\xa0L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food, was published in the Fall of\xa02013. \n\nTicket sales are final. ",

Teams will envision, map and pitch a startup in immersive journalism and VR that can deliver a singular idea, product, service, or process to serve the public in journalism. Rather than be a traditional Hackathon focused on coding and building, this one will be about collaboration, team-building and entrepreneurship. \nHOST SCHOOL \nThe Hackathon will be hosted by the USC Annenberg School of Journalism and Communication, bringing in female college students from the region and around the country to invent and envision their role and influence in an emerging technology market.

Believing that her mother\u2019s cuisine was far too flavorful to be kept an island secret, she left her day job in LA in 2007, and returned to Hawaii to study in her mother\u2019s kitchen, determined to bring her family\u2019s light, bright and savory dishes to the masses.In the fall of 2009,\xa0Mandoline Grill\xa0launched at the Verdugo Bar in Glassell Park. For these first few months, Mong supplied her own fryers, toaster oven, and coolers, basically throwing a backyard cookout at the beloved Eastside bar. As support grew, Mong started riding shotgun and working shifts on the Dosa Truck, just to get a hang of the food truck life before hitting the streets in her own truck this past February 2010. Now Mong has the privilege of introducing her mother\u2019s inspirational flavors to LA (and beyond!) as she drives the Mandoline Grill truck from Orange County to Echo Park to Santa Monica, offering fresh, crisp vegan and carnivore-friendly b\xe1nh m\xec sandwiches, and of course, her mother\u2019s famous b\xfan th\u1ecbt n\u01b0\u1edbng noodle bowls. \nYou can find the Mandoline Grill Truck on Twitter here!\xa0@MandolineGrill \n\xa0 \n\xa0 \n\xa0 \n\xa0 \n\xa0 \n\xa0 \n\xa0 \n\xa0 \nParking available for vendors and visitors.\xa0 \nFor more information, contact Ez Event Production at (310) 473-3070.
