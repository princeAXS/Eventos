    'description': ' with Wild Ones, Psychic Twin<br> Daniel Hindman and Sarah Versprille began writing songs together in 2009 while living in Brooklyn, NY. In 2011, the duo packed up their lives, moved to Portland, OR and realized that it was time to put a name to the batch of songs they&#39;d been working on -- Pure Bathing Culture was born. Through various serendipitous connections, multi-instrumentalist and producer Richard Swift (Secretly Canadian) heard their early demos and immediately invited them to record with him at his National Freedom Studio in Cottage Grove, OR. The fruits of this recording session comprise their self-titled EP, an elegant collection of four beautiful songs, constructed with smooth melodies embodying the nostalgia of soft soulful 80s pop but with a freshness all of their own.',

    'description': u ' For over ten years Red Dress Gala has allowed current Beta Pi members to celebrate the Alpha Phi Foundation in the company of guests, like yourselves, who understand how important philanthropy is now and in the future. The national organization of Alpha Phi first chose Polio as the charity it would support. \xa0When Polio was eradicated, Alpha Phi turned it&#39;s attention to the number one killer of women in the United States; Heart Disease. \xa0The Alpha Phi Foundation supports women&#39;s heart health throughout the nation and seeks to, yet again, eradicate a terrible killer. \xa0 The Foundation has awarded more than $300,000 within the last 2 years to support scholarships, emergency financial assistance, local charities designated by chapters, leadership training opportunities and educational programs. In 2014, the Beta Pi chapter raised $52,110 making us one of the top ten fundraising chapters in the country. This year, we\u2019re looking to increase that number with your help! \xa0 HOTEL RESERVATIONS:\xa0If you are interested in staying at the Sheraton Hotel Downtown LA, Alpha Phi has a special rate available for Red Dress Gala guests. Please click here for more information on discounted room rates.\xa0 \xa0 FAQs Do I need to buy a ticket for any Alpha Phi Beta Pi ACTIVE members?\xa0No! 2015-2016 active members have already paid for a ticket via their dues.\xa0 What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?\xa0Parking is available at the Sheraton Downtown Los Angeles Hotel via Valet.\xa0 Can I donate to the Alpha Phi Foundation prior to the event?\xa0Yes! Donations can be made directly to the Alpha Phi Foundation online here.

    'description': u ' <p>DIESEL, A Bookstore in Brentwood welcomes author<strong>\xa0Michaela Haas,\xa0</strong>PhD.<strong>\xa0</strong>to the store to discuss and sign her new motivational book,<em><strong>\xa0Bouncing Forward: Transforming Bad Breaks Into Breakthroughs</strong></em>, on Tuesday, October 20th at 6:30pm.<p>The uplifting science of posttraumatic growth presents groundbreaking research and proven methods to survive and thrive in the face of challenges. Twelve inspiring role models share their profound insights on how they emerged from hardship stronger, wiser, and more compassionate--among them civil rights icon Maya Angelou, who healed deep childhood trauma; flight surgeon Rhonda Cornum, who found a new purpose after being captured in Iraq; renowned autistic pioneer Temple Grandin, who overcame crippling panic attacks; and famed jazz guitarist Coco Schumann, who played for his life in Auschwitz. In<strong><em> Bouncing Forward</em></strong>, <strong>Michaela Haas </strong>draws upon powerful storytelling, psychology, history, and twenty years of Buddhist practice to reshape the way we think of crisis.<p>Unlike books from the medical community, <strong><em>Bouncing Forward</em></strong> is a user-friendly source of techniques actual trauma survivors have used to benefit from pain and adversity. Haas draws on common coping threads to beautifully combine inspirational stories of growth through trauma with science and spirituality. Perfect for people from all walks of life who are recovering from loss, pain, illness, and violence--as well as their friends and family--<strong><em>Bouncing Forward</em></strong> offers examples and inspiration for growth and a mindful approach to dealing with suffering, and finding a deeper meaning in life.<p><strong>Michaela Haas,</strong> PhD., is an international reporter, lecturer, author, and consultant. She is the owner of HAAS live!, an international coaching company that combines her experience in media with mindfulness training. With a PhD in Asian Studies, she has been teaching Buddhism at the University of California Santa Barbara, the University of the West, and various Buddhist centers in America and Europe. Michaela divides her time between Malibu, California, and Munich, Germany.\xa0</p></p></p></p>',
